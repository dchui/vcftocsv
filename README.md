# vcftocsv
Makeshift Spring Boot app to convert VCF exports from OSX's Contacts app to CSV.

1. Build the application as you normally would and run it. It requires only the path to the VCF file to run.
1. Optionally, the CSV can be output to a file using the `-o` command line argument. By default, the CSV is output to stdout.
